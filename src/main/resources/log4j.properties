# This is the developer runtime log settings. They only affect the client when
# started through netbeans or the maven target (nbm:run-platform) and are not
# shipped with the client releases.
#
# Log4j Levels are (in order)
# trace, debug, info, warn, error
#
# trace should be used for all debug output that causes large amounts of log data
# debug is for less verbose debug output, for example start or exit of some component
# warn is for problems that should be solved but does not affect the system
# error is for unrecoverable problems in the client

# This is our default appender: direct log messages to stdout
